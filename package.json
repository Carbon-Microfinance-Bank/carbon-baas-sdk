  "description": "## Welcome to our API Developer Documentation\n\nCarbon aims to unlock the full potential of your business with a feature-rich account designed for growth.\n\n## Integrations\n\nWe aim to provide our APIs for developers and businesses to offer financial services to their existing customer base through REST APIs without doing the heavy lifting. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n\n### Authentication\n\n`Authorization : API Key`\n\nHeader  \n`x-carbon-key : value`\n\n`x-carbon-key` can be generated via developer page on Carbon Business\n\n| Enviroment | URL |\n| --- | --- |\n| Live |  |\n| Sandbox | [https://carbonapistagingsecure.getcarbon.co/baas/api](https://carbonapistagingsecure.getcarbon.co/baas/api) |\n\n### **Handling Errors**\n\nWe use the conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.  \nCodes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers.\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 400 - Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |\n| 401 - Unauthorized | Not a valid API key was provided. |\n| 402 - Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |\n| 403 - Forbidden | The API key doesn't have permission to perform the request. |\n| 404 - Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist. |\n| 429 - Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API |\n| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | System Error |",
